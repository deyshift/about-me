**Software Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps Enthusiast**

I’m a Software Engineer with a strong focus on cloud infrastructure, observability, and DevOps. Most of my work revolves around designing and deploying scalable cloud-native systems using tools like Terraform/OpenTofu, Kubernetes, Helm, and AWS—often with Go or Python in the mix.

Currently, I'm building enterprise-grade observability stacks in an EKS environment, automating deployments with Infrastructure as Code, and integrating telemetry pipelines that track logs, metrics, and traces. I recently implemented the full OpenTelemetry and Grafana LGTM stack—Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir—to provide real-time visibility into Kubernetes workloads. This included configuring OpenTelemetry Collector pipelines, securing access via IAM and OAuth, and designing Grafana dashboards for API performance monitoring.

I enjoy working on high-impact infrastructure projects where reliability and visibility matter. From automating lifecycle policies for cloud storage to tuning dashboards for actionable insights, I aim to make systems easier to operate and scale.

Lately, I’ve also been exploring how agentic AI tools can accelerate cloud engineering workflows—from prototyping infrastructure to debugging services—especially in fast-moving environments.

As I continue to grow, I’m focused on deepening my expertise in observability, secure cloud deployments, and automation that scales.

### [Clip Vault](https://github.com/surlystack/clipvault)  
**Personal Full-Stack Project** (Ongoing)  
A web application designed to store, organize, and manage code snippets effectively, featuring tagging, code editor integration for language validation and syntax highlighting, and advanced search capabilities.

**Highlights**:
- Developed a responsive UI using Angular 20 standalone components.
- Integrated Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting and supported language validation.
- Built a robust backend with ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL, implementing JWT-based authentication.  
- Designed a tagging system to enhance snippet categorization and retrieval.

### [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/153775)  
**Open Source Contribution**  
Refactored the FX pass logging in PyTorch to separate verbose/intermediate graph logs from final output graph logs. Introduced a new artifact logger (`graph_code_verbose`) so that only final output graphs log to the original artifact, improving log clarity and developer experience without changing FX pass logic or user-facing APIs.

**Highlights**:
- Refactored `insert_deferred_runtime_asserts` and related logging to reduce noise and improve the development workflow.
- Added a dedicated artifact logger for verbose FX pass logs, making debugging and log parsing simpler.
- Ensured backward compatibility and preserved existing functionality for all users and contributors.

### [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/6749)
**Open Source Contribution (Pending Merge)**  
Collaborated on improving Scrapy’s behavior for filtering items by reviewing and providing feedback on a pull request. The enhancement introduces a more flexible approach to handle inclusion and exclusion rules, allowing developers to define whether inclusion or exclusion takes precedence when both rules apply to the same item.

**Highlights**:
- Contributed by reviewing the implementation and suggesting improvements to ensure high-quality standards.
- Helped refine the logic to simplify how developers manage conflicting inclusion and exclusion rules.
- Enhanced Scrapy’s flexibility, making it more adaptable to real-world scenarios where filtering criteria can overlap.

### [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/13394)  
**Open Source Contribution**  
Fixed a bug in pytest's production code that caused test durations to appear negative, improving timing accuracy and ensuring reliable test reports. Contributed to the changelog to document the fix.

**Highlights**:
- Enhanced the accuracy of test duration reporting in pytest.
- Collaborated with the open-source community to review and merge the fix.
- Improved reliability and usability of the pytest framework for developers.

### [MyLibrary Web Application](https://github.com/surlystack/mylibrary-app)
